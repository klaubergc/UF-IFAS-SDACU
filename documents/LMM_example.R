# Workshop: Linear Mixed Models (LMM) in R
# Example: Tree growth of evergreen vs. deciduous species
###############################################################

# Research Question:
# Do evergreen species grow more or less than deciduous species,
# while accounting for tree height and species-level variation?

# Hypotheses:
# H0: Evergreen and deciduous species show no difference in growth.
# H1: Evergreen and deciduous species differ in growth rates.

# Overall Objective:
# To introduce the use of Linear Mixed Models (LMM) for hierarchical data.

# Specific Objectives:
# - Explore the dataset (EDA).
# - Compare linear fixed-effect models with LMM.
# - Evaluate assumptions (normality, homoscedasticity).
# - Interpret results using coefficients, random effects, and R².
# - Visualize predictions and residuals.

# Dataset description:
# growth : Tree growth in diameter (mm/year) - numeric variable
# sp     : Species identifier (e.g., sp01, sp02...) - categorical
# pft    : Plant Functional Type (deciduous / evergreen) - categorical
# height : Tree height (m) - numeric variable

# 3) Linear Mixed-Effects Model Selection
###############################################################

# Step 1: Full mixed model (random slope + intercept for species)
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Fixed effects:
#   - height (continuous predictor of growth, in meters)
#   - pft (plant functional type: deciduous vs evergreen)
#   - height:pft interaction (tests whether the slope of growth vs. height
#     differs between deciduous and evergreen species)
#
# Random effects:
#   - (height | sp): allows each species (sp) to have:
#       * its own intercept (baseline growth)
#       * its own slope with respect to height
#   This structure captures both baseline differences among species
#   and species-specific responses to tree height.
#
# Model formula:
lmm_full <- lmer(growth ~ height + pft + height:pft + (height | sp), data = dataset)
summary(lmm_full)

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Notes on fixed effects coding:
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# - R encodes categorical variables (factors) with dummy variables.
# - The first level (alphabetical by default) is used as the "reference".
# - Here, pft has two levels: "deciduous" (reference) and "evergreen".
#   → "pftevergreen" means the difference for evergreen species relative
#     to deciduous.
#
# Interpretation of coefficients:
# - (Intercept): expected growth for deciduous species at height = 0.
# - height: slope of growth vs. height for deciduous species.
# - pftevergreen: difference in baseline growth between evergreen
#                 and deciduous species.
# - height:pftevergreen: difference in slope of height effect between
#                        evergreen and deciduous species.


# Step 2: Random intercept model (simpler random structure)
# Fixed effects:
#   - height (continuous predictor of growth)
#   - pft (plant functional type: deciduous vs evergreen)
#   - height:pft interaction (does the effect of height differ by PFT?)
# Random effects:
#   - (1 | sp): only the intercept varies by species,
#     meaning species differ in baseline growth but share the same slope.
# Notes:
#   This is simpler than the random slope model, because it assumes
#   all species respond to height in the same way (parallel lines),
#   but they may start from different baseline levels of growth.
lmm_ri <- lmer(growth ~ height + pft + height:pft + (1 | sp), data = dataset)   # fit LMM with random intercept only
summary(lmm_ri)                                                    # show summary of fixed + random effects

# Compare random slope vs random intercept
anova(lmm_full, lmm_ri, refit = FALSE)                             # likelihood ratio test: slope vs intercept
# If p < 0.05 → keep random slopes
# If p > 0.05 → random intercept is sufficient

# Step 3: Remove interaction (height:pft)
lmm_no_interaction <- lmer(growth ~ height + pft + (height | sp), data = dataset)  # drop interaction term
anova(lmm_full, lmm_no_interaction)                                                # test if interaction is significant
# If p > 0.05 → interaction not needed, keep simpler model

# Step 4: Remove plant functional type effect (pft)
lmm_no_pft <- lmer(growth ~ height + (height | sp), data = dataset)   # drop pft (evergreen/deciduous) effect
anova(lmm_no_pft, lmm_no_interaction)                                 # compare with model including pft
# If p < 0.05 → pft effect matters, keep in model

# Step 5: Remove height effect
lmm_no_height <- lmer(growth ~ pft + (height | sp), data = dataset)   # drop height effect
anova(lmm_no_interaction, lmm_no_height)                              # compare with model including height
# If p < 0.05 → height matters, keep in model

# Final chosen model
final_model <- lmm_no_interaction                                      # assign the selected best model
summary(final_model)                                                   # show results (coefficients, SE, p-values)
fixef(final_model)                                                     # extract fixed effects only
ranef(final_model)                                                     # extract random effects only

# Interpretation of fixed effects:
#   
# Intercept (0.124)
# This is the baseline growth rate (in mm/year) for the reference group (deciduous species) when tree height = 0.
# (Of course, height = 0 is not realistic, but it anchors the model.)
# 
# height (0.0513)
# For every 1 meter increase in tree height, tree growth increases by about 0.051 mm/year (on average, across species).
# This slope applies to both deciduous and evergreen species.
# 
# pftevergreen (0.3623)
# Evergreen species grow, on average, 0.36 mm/year more than deciduous species (the reference group), after accounting for tree height.
# This shows the functional type effect.
# 
# So, the model equation can be written as:
#   
#   Deciduous species:
#   Growth = 0.124 + 0.051 × Height
# 
# Evergreen species:
#   Growth = (0.124 + 0.362) + 0.051 × Height
# Growth = 0.486 + 0.051 × Height

# Interpretation of species-level random effects:

# Each row shows species-specific deviations (BLUPs) from the population fixed effects:
#   (Intercept): -> how the baseline (at Height = 0) for species s differs from the global intercept
#   height    :  -> how the Height slope for species s differs from the global height slope
# Positive values = above-average (higher intercept or steeper slope); negative = below-average.
# If your model includes pftevergreen as a fixed effect, it shifts the INTERCEPT only (no pft:height term),
# so random slope differences are unrelated to PFT unless you add that interaction.

# Quick read of the output:
# sp01:  intercept -0.0156 (slightly lower baseline), slope -0.0130 (slightly flatter than average)
# sp02:  intercept +0.0218 (slightly higher baseline), slope +0.0231 (steeper than average)
# sp03:  intercept +0.0767 (higher baseline),        slope +0.0399 (notably steeper than average)
# sp04:  intercept +0.1402 (higher baseline),        slope -0.0171 (somewhat flatter)
# sp05:  intercept -0.2143 (much lower baseline),    slope -0.0073 (slightly flatter)
# sp06:  intercept +0.0865 (higher baseline),        slope +0.0363 (steeper than average)
# sp07:  intercept -0.1112 (lower baseline),         slope -0.0179 (flatter)
# sp08:  intercept +0.2408 (highest baseline),       slope -0.0191 (flatter; height effect reduced)
# sp09:  intercept -0.2921 (lowest baseline),        slope -0.0122 (slightly flatter)
# sp10:  intercept +0.0673 (slightly higher),        slope -0.0126 (slightly flatter)

# Key Takeaways:
#
# - Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMs) handle hierarchical data:
#   Useful when data are grouped (e.g., trees within species, plots, or sites),
#   capturing both fixed effects (population-level) and random effects (group-level).
#
# - Model selection is based on ANOVA comparisons:
#   Allows testing which fixed and random effects improve the model.
#   Parsimonious models (simpler but informative) are preferred.

# - Model diagnostics are essential:
#   Residual plots check linearity and homoscedasticity,
#   Shapiro-Wilk test and histograms assess normality,
#   and Levene’s test checks homogeneity of variances.
#
# - R² interpretation for mixed models:
#   * Marginal R² = variance explained by fixed effects only.
#   * Conditional R² = variance explained by both fixed + random effects.
#   This distinction shows the added contribution of random effects.
#
# - Visualization enhances interpretation:
#   Scatterplots, residual plots, and fitted vs observed predictions
#   clarify how fixed and random effects contribute to explaining variation.
#
# - Practical insight:
#   In this example, both tree height and plant functional type (PFT: deciduous vs evergreen)
#   were informative predictors of tree growth, while random effects captured
#   species-specific deviations around these general trends.
